<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/index_white.png" alt="Product Name Screen Shot White" width="750" />
</div>

A versatile web application that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assist users in evaluating policy documents for its acceptability and identifying potential issues. The tool provides users with an efficient and effective means of ensuring that their policies adhere to predefined standards, all while highlighting and summarising the problematic parts of the policies.
The current workflow is:

- Data Preparation: Text data was preprocessed to normalize case, remove stopwords, tokenize, and lemmatize it.
- Data Extraction: Word2Vec, trained on Google News data, transformed text into numerical vectors, capturing semantic word relationships.
- Machine Learning Models: Various models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were used for text classification. Hyperparameter tuning enhanced model performance.
- Problematic Phrases: Highlighted problematic phrases in text using HTML <span> with red background.
- Summarization: Automated text summarization with the BART model from HuggingFace to generate concise summaries.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Setup

1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/Ethan4thewin/NLP-policy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repo.
2. Download the pre-trained word embeddings from Google News Word2Vec, unzip and put the .bin file in the main folder.

- HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/NathaNn1111/word2vec-google-news-negative-300-bin
- Google Drive (zip): https://drive.google.com/file/d/154QtCXQWAMNS46v9kxjAMm3zq2fRnIVm/view?usp=sharing
- Alternative Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QsLGJwOWkNoekIASH0cCar07vaoYZN33/view?usp=sharing

3. Install required packages
   All packages use:
   1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
   2. **numpy**: For numerical operations and arrays.
   3. **gensim**: For Word2Vec model usage.
   4. **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including classifiers, evaluation metrics, and preprocessing tools.
   5. **nltk**: For natural language processing tasks, such as text tokenization and stopword removal.
   6. **string**: Python standard library for string operations.
   7. **keras**: For deep learning models, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in your code.
   8. **transformers**: For working with pre-trained models from HuggingFace (used for summarization).
   9. **tensorflow**: Required for Keras and deep learning models.
   10. **flask** or **streamlit**: For developing web applications (if used).

```sh
pip install pandas numpy gensim scikit-learn nltk string keras transformers tensorflow flask streamlit
```

### Flask deployment (assuming Flask is installed)

> The model used in this instance is SVM, with tested result up to 95% accuracy.

1. Run app_flask.py. It will start a web server on Flask that listens on a specified port (usually port 5000 by default).
2. Connect to localhost:_insert specified port_ (by default, it will be localhost:5000) on a web browser. The web app should be displayed.

### Streamlit deployment (assuming Streamlit is installed)

> The model used in this instance is SVM, with tested result up to 95% accuracy.

1. Run app_streamlit.py. It will start a web server on Streamlit that listens on a specified port (usually port 8501 by default).
2. Connect to localhost:_insert specified port_ (by default, it will be localhost:8501) on a web browser. The web app should be displayed.

### Configurations

The classification model is currently SVM model in the .pkl file from the current five models pool: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and CNN. The classification model can be changed by running the [Notebook](final_code.ipynb) and change the function `classify_policy(policy_text)` by uncomment the desired model. Then, you can rerun the notebook and the app.py to reflect the changes.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The project's primary usage is for text classification and summarization. It can be applied to automatically categorize and generate concise summaries of text data, making it useful for tasks such as content moderation, information retrieval, and document summarization. The web application (if deployed) provides a user-friendly interface for accessing these functionalities.
